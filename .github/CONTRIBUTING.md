## Requirements
There are a couple requirements that need to be met before a pull request can be accepted.

- All tests need to pass.
- Code needs to have documentation where necessary. If we believe the documentation is not clear enough, we will let you know on the pull request.
- Maintainers need to review and approve the changes before a pull request can be merged.
- No commits to the master branch should be made. All changes should be made through pull requests.

If you have any questions about these requirements, feel free to ask.
